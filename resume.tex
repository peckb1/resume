\subsection*{Software Engineer L6, Doordash (Caviar/Drive), 2019-present }
\label{sec 1-1}
\label{sec-1-1-1}
\subsection*{Bring functionality into microservice for monolith decomission}
\begin{itemize}
\item Extract existing, and create new functionality, inside Kotlin microservices while decomissioning a Python monolith. Ensuring code quality, and correct idioms with a focus on bringing runtime errors down to compile time checks.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Software Engineer L6, Square (Caviar), 2017 - 2019}
\label{sec-1-2}
\subsubsection*{Caviar <-> Square Order Integration}
\label{sec-1-2-1}

\begin{itemize}
\item Designed, built, and maintained integration between Caviar and Square Orders for merchants on both platforms. Handled the creation of orders in Square's system, kept the orders in sync between systems, and ensured transitions were tracked for historical and debugging purposes.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Migrated event notifications into SNS/SQS}
\label{sec-1-2-1}
\begin{itemize}
\item Transitioned event notifications from a service to service call into SNS/SQS broadcasting, facilitating the sending of events to microservices as functionaly was being pulled out of a monolith.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Sr. Software Engineer, Autodesk, 2015 - 2017}
\label{sec-1-3}
\subsubsection*{API Objective Reporting Service}
\label{sec-1-3-1}

\begin{itemize}
\item Designed and built a service for generating and reporting internal APIs' metrics. These metrics are used in determining if a given service is meeting predetermined objectives, in particular concerning latency and error percentage.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Model Commenting REST API}
\label{sec-1-3-2}

\begin{itemize}
\item Extracted a set of REST APIs from a deprecated legacy system. Brought code base up to modern standards and bext practices. Upgraded dependencies and depoyment resources to use non deprecated libraries.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Software Engineer, Brigade, 2014 - 2015}
\label{sec-1-4}
\subsubsection*{Brigade Android Application}
\label{sec-1-4-1}

\begin{itemize}
\item Developed native Android OS application. Responsible for user facing elements, API layer interaction, and event based communication between custom elements across the application.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Software Engineer, Apartment List, 2014}
\label{sec-1-5}
\subsubsection*{Apartment List Android Application}
\label{sec-1-5-1}

\begin{itemize}
\item Designed and developed the native Android OS application for Apartment List. Responsible for high visibility consumer facing features, and managing of user-data stored on the device and its synchronization with server side APIs.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Software Engineer, Intel, 2012 - 2014}
\label{sec-1-6}
\subsubsection*{Ingestion and Management of data from external sources to front end data systems}
\label{sec-1-6-1}

\begin{itemize}
\item Designed and developed Scala-based system for loading, and managing external provider data. Worked from initial prototype stages to production ready system on the ability to ingest, curate, and serve specific data to front end consumers.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Software Engineer, Lockheed Martin Advanced Technologies, 2007 - 2012}
\label{sec-1-7}
\subsubsection*{Systems Biology Simulation Framework}
\label{sec-1-7-1}

\begin{itemize}
\item Lead developer of a Scala-based network modeling framework for the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Responsible for the development and maintenance of algorithms and user interfaces allowing biologists to model genetic reactions.
\end{itemize}
