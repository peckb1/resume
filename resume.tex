\label{sec-1-1}
\subsubsection*{Brigade Android Application}
\label{sec-1-1-1}

\begin{itemize}
\item Developed native Android OS application. Responsible for user facing elements, API layer interaction, and event based communication between custom elements across the application.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Software Engineer, Apartment List, 2014}
\label{sec-1-2}
\subsubsection*{Apartment List Android Application}
\label{sec-1-2-1}

\begin{itemize}
\item Designed and developed the native Android OS application for Apartment List. Responsible for high visibility consumer facing features, and managing of user-data stored on the device and its synchronization with server side APIs.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Software Engineer, Intel, 2012 - 2014}
\label{sec-1-3}
\subsubsection*{Ingestion and Management of data from external sources to front end data systems}
\label{sec-1-3-1}

\begin{itemize}
\item Designed and developed Scala-based system for loading, and managing external provider data. Worked from initial prototype stages to production ready system on the ability to ingest, curate, and serve specific data to front end consumers.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Software Engineer, Lockheed Martin Advanced Technologies, 2007 - 2012}
\label{sec-1-4}
