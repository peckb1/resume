\section*{Experience}
\label{sec-1}

\subsection*{Software Engineer, Lockheed Martin Advanced Technologies, 2007 - Present}
\label{sec-1.1}

\subsubsection*{Systems Biology Simulation Framework}
\label{sec-1.1.1}

\begin{itemize}
\item Lead developer of a Scala-based network modeling framework for the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Responsible for the development and maintenance of algorithms and user interfaces allowing biologists to model genetic reactions. Framework allows run-time compilation of user-built networks through the user of ScalaScriptEngine.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Distributed Event Log Aggregator}
\label{sec-1.1.2}

\begin{itemize}
\item Lead developer of a Java-based, security log aggregation and auditing tool for use across secure networks which enables the remote locating, querying, and processing of logs for auditing, including client and server-side filtering capabilities. Integrated with OS independent tools to allow for use on networks with current and legacy systems.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{RESTful Web Services allowing Command and Control for Office of Naval Research}
\label{sec-1.1.3}

\begin{itemize}
\item Developed web applications and RESTful services for Navy Command and Control (C2) capabilities, used in weekly planning and organizational briefings to Navy Admirals. Created command relationship tool and additional web services providing XML and JSON data to other C2 applications.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Augmented Reality Prototyping for DARPA ULTRA-Vis}
\label{sec-1.1.4}

\begin{itemize}
\item Developed prototype of a wearable, P2P, augmented reality system to enhance the warfighter's situational awareness. Developed P2P communication systems and integrated a head-mounted display with cameras creating a 3D model of the current viewable area and directional sensors from five partners to allow functionality in and out of GPS challenged environments. Successful field demonstration to DARPA personnel in January 2010.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Test Automation Framework}
\label{sec-1.1.5}

\begin{itemize}
\item Developed a Python-based test automation framework resulting in a reduction of testing time by a factor of 60. Provided project developers with examples to allow automation of existing manual tests. Led a workshop to train the development team on the framework, which was then adopted by the team and used for two years until project completion.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Web Development Intern, USGS Astrogeology, 2006 - 2007}
\label{sec-1.2}

\begin{itemize}
\item Developed and maintained websites for the USGS Astrogeology Department using JavaScript, HTML, and Perl. Updated and expanded content, and improved user experience for existing NASA imagery viewer available at \href{http://www.mapaplanet.org}{http://www.mapaplanet.org}. Integrated Perl scripts with GIS enabled databases to provide on-demand content to users.
\end{itemize}
