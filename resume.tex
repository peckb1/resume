\label{sec-1-2}
\subsubsection*{Brigade Android Application}
\label{sec-1-2-1}

\begin{itemize}
\item Developed native Android OS application. Responsible for user facing elements, API layer interaction, and event based communication between custom elements across the application.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Software Engineer, Apartment List, 2014}
\label{sec-1-3}
\subsubsection*{Apartment List Android Application}
\label{sec-1-3-1}

\begin{itemize}
\item Designed and developed the native Android OS application for Apartment List. Responsible for high visibility consumer facing features, and managing of user-data stored on the device and its synchronization with server side APIs.
\end{itemize}
